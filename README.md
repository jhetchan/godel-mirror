# 🪞 Gödel Mirror

**Self-Recursive Architectures for Emergent Cognition via Contradiction Resolution**

This repository contains the full Lean implementation of the Gödel Mirror system — a symbolic architecture that evolves by recursively detecting, embodying, and resolving internal contradictions.

🧠 **Key Idea**:  
Contradiction is not failure — it's a trigger for structural transformation.

## 🔧 What’s Inside

| Component        | Description                                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MirrorSystem`   | Inductive type defining the symbolic universe                     |
| `MirrorState`    | Classification of symbolic states: Normal, Paradox, Emergence…    |
| `MirrorAgent`    | Recursive engine for symbolic evolution                           |
| `Evaluator`      | Logic for detecting paradox, emergence, and valid reentry         |
| `Trace Runner`   | Step-by-step symbolic trace with emoji visualization              |
| `Theorems`       | Formal proofs of key transitions (e.g., paradox → embody)         |

## 📦 Example: Gödel-Initiated Run

```lean
def custom_start := named "Gödel" (node self_ref)
#eval numbered_trace (run_trace custom_start 4)

Output:
Step 0: 🏷 Gödel
Step 1: 🔥 embody
Step 2: 🌱 reenter
Step 3: 🔁 node
Step 4: 🔁 node
This trace demonstrates how the system detects a self-referential contradiction and recursively restructures around it.

Preprint (arXiv link coming soon)
Chan, J. (2025). The Gödel Mirror: Self-Recursive Architectures for Emergent Cognition via Contradiction Resolution.

🧩 Background
The Gödel Mirror builds on ideas from:
Gödel’s incompleteness and self-reference
Autopoietic systems and reentry (Varela, Spencer-Brown)
Meta-cognitive loops and reflective architectures
Type-theoretic symbolic modeling (Lean)

🛠️ Next Steps
 Add MirrorTrace, MirrorLoop, and composable symbolic grammar
 Bridge with perception-action interface
 Integrate with LLMs via external symbol grounding
 Visual trace tree explorer

Inspired by the recursive paradox at the heart of Gödel’s theorems — and all the agents, human and artificial, learning to grow by reflecting on their own breakdowns.

## TODO
# 🧠 Gödel Mirror – Lean 4 Refactor

This is the working TODO list to refactor the current monolithic Lean file into a clean, importable Lake project for reuse, extension, and formal experimentation.

---

## 📦 Project Setup

- [ ] Initialize Lake project with `lake init GodelMirror`
- [ ] Add `lean-toolchain` (e.g. `leanprover/lean4:nightly` or a fixed version)
- [ ] Set up folder structure:
  - [ ] `GodelMirror/`
  - [ ] `Main.lean`
  - [ ] `lakefile.lean`

## 📂 Code Modularization

- [ ] Split monolithic file into logical modules:
  - [ ] `GodelMirror/Axioms.lean` – foundational axioms, Gödel-style structure
  - [ ] `GodelMirror/Types.lean` – custom types, symbolic structures
  - [ ] `GodelMirror/Core.lean` – logic engine, proof combinators
  - [ ] `GodelMirror/Engine.lean` – contradiction resolution machinery
  - [ ] `GodelMirror/Examples.lean` – illustrative instantiations and demos

- [ ] Add `import` statements as needed
- [ ] Make sure all files compile with `lake build`

## 📖 Docs & Dev UX

- [ ] Add comments to all key definitions and proofs
- [ ] Create a `docs/` folder:
  - [ ] `overview.md` – explanation of module responsibilities
  - [ ] `walkthrough.md` – minimal working example
  - [ ] `design.md` – system architecture / logic design choices

## 🧪 Testing

- [ ] Add `#check`, `#eval`, or `example` proofs where relevant
- [ ] Add `Main.lean` as playground / entrypoint
- [ ] Optional: create `tests/` folder for formal unit testing (future)

## 🚀 Contributor-Ready

- [ ] Add `README.md` with:
  - [ ] Overview of Gödel Mirror
  - [ ] Setup instructions: Lean toolchain, Lake build, how to run
  - [ ] Structure map of modules

- [ ] Add `LICENSE` (MIT or Apache-2.0 recommended)
- [ ] Add `.gitignore` (Lean/Lake defaults)
- [ ] Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` for dev guidance
- [ ] Add GitHub topics: `lean4`, `logic`, `godel`, `symbolic-ai`, `paraconsistency`

## 🌱 Future

- [ ] Make `GodelMirror` importable as a dependency
- [ ] Publish annotated notebook version (e.g., LeanInk or markdown + Lean snippets)
- [ ] Link to whitepaper preprint (arXiv or PDF)
- [ ] Invite early contributors for feedback / idea iteration
